                        The less you are concerned with others, the more you can focus on doing what matters most to you. What others say does not reflect the real you. It is just their perception, which may not be the full picture or the truth.

                        Look for things i are passionate about. Advocate to make myself and others heard. Join groups that support your beliefs.So, decide what my value and what i stand for. Then, i can do anything.

                        I feel like, this year, I don’t have as many personal goals as I do some years – it feels like I have a pretty good routine going right now and I don’t feel compelled to tweak too many things.

                I must start with how to get there and break down the steps. These steps must be realistic.Dream big no matter what but be realistic at the same time. Be open to detours, too.This is kind of strange for me because usually my list of goals for the upcoming year is a mile long.

                The best communicators are almost always the best listeners. Listen without judgment and don’t be distracted by thinking about what you want to say next. Then, respond, not
                react.Whether speaking to a crowd or one-on-one, maintaining eye contact builds credibility and demonstrates you care about your listeners.
